# CVE-2010-5301
**A proof of concept of an SEH overflow with arbitrary dll injection**

## Description
Kolibrì HTTP Server 2.0 is affected by a **stack-based buffer overflow**. At the time of discovery this vulnerability was exploited by simply overwriting the instruction pointer with a JMP ESP instruction, where ESP pointed to shellcode dropped on the stack. Subsequently, it was found that the SEH chain could be overwritten if a larger payload was sent. The application does not have valid POP - POP - RET instructions to make the SE handler point to the next SEH record though. This is because all related memory addresses start with a nullbyte.

## The Exploit
This exploit proposes code execution via SEH overflow through DLL injection. Injecting an arbitrary DLL into the Kolibrì process opens up an opportunity for overwriting the SE handler with a nullbyte-free address pointing to a POP - POP - RET instruction from that DLL. Clearly this method can only be used to develop a proof of concept, and cannot be relied on if exploitation is carried out to elevate system privileges locally. This is because you need to have the same privileges of the target process if you want to inject a DLL into it. Other than that, the exploit works!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Disclaimer
Bear in mind that this exploit works only with short custom shellcodes at the moment. An msfvenom payload cannot be used because it is too large. So the poc should be adjusted accordingly by either implementing an egghunter or deploying the shellcode in the buffer space and jumping a couple times backwards from the nSEH record pointer (currently working out a solution). With this being said, if you want to try it out I suggest using the custom shellcode for *calc.exe* (calc.asm) in this repo and replacing WinExec and ExitProcess addresses with those of your system.

All I have done is applying the idea to this specific CVE.
